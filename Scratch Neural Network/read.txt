#Implementing a Neural Network from scratch using only numpy & math libraries
#Classical prediction of hand written notes using [insert data]

Only 3 layers
1. Input layer, transposed pixel data 28x28
2. W[1]*A[0] + b[1] = z[1], ReLu*(z[1])
3. softmax function

Will also implement back propagation to have weights walk down similar to gradient descent
